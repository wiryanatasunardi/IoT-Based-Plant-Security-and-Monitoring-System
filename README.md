# IoT Based Plant Security and Monitoring System

The ESP32-CAM is a full-featured microcontroller with an integrated video camera and microSD card socket. It is inexpensive, easy to use, and perfect for IoT devices requiring a camera with advanced functions like image tracking and recognition. The ESP32-CAM module has fewer I/O pins than the ESP-32 module. Many GPIO pins are used internally for the camera and the microSD card port. Another thing missing from the ESP32-CAM module is a USB port. To program this device, I need to use an FTDI adapter. Since the ESP32 and ESP32-CAM support IoT features, I am interested in making a project on agriculture technology by combining the IoT features with the sensor and camera. For example, soil moisture sensors have many applications in agriculture, research, and everyday gardening. By keeping tabs on the amount of water in the soil, we can make sure our precious crop stays hydrated or get an idea of the conditions before planting. Moreover, I also use DHT11 - This low-cost temperature sensor also measures humidity. It has a serial digital output and can easily be used with most microcontrollers.
